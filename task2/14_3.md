Nowadays, with the international communication becoming increase, more and more people in different nations and cultures linking closely. Some individuals argue that music is a good method to bring people of different cultures and ages together. But others don't think so. In my assessment, I agree with this viewpoint. Here are my arguments to support my point. 

Firstly, music can create topics for people, although they are in different cultures. People who strange other cultures can knowledge the motion by music even if they may can not understand the meaning of the sentences. To this motion, People can make friends who have same consensus and devotion in this style.They have same hobby to communication and then get closer gradually.  

Secondly, music as the one way to participate social activities, can create a relaxed atmosphere. People sing together in this environment can quickly establish connections, give them interesting experience when share their music cultures to promote social interaction and cultural exchange. 

Then, music is an eternal art. Music created in ancient or modern time, they always have people who fond them, The works of classical music composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. are still performed and appreciated today. Modern music is also constantly innovating, leaving the imprint of the times. Music is an art that transcends time and can establish connections with people from different ages.

## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇更流畅且结构更清晰的范文，仅供参考。你可在此基础上结合自身思路进行修改和学习。

> **题目**：Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together.  
> **范文**：
> 
> In today’s increasingly interconnected world, cultural and generational gaps sometimes seem insurmountable. However, many believe that music has the power to unite people regardless of their backgrounds. I fully agree with this view and will discuss why music can bridge cultural and age differences.
> 
> To begin with, music serves as a universal language that transcends linguistic barriers. Even if individuals cannot understand the lyrics, they can still appreciate the rhythm, melody, and emotion conveyed in a piece of music. For example, many Western listeners enjoy K-pop or Latin music without speaking Korean or Spanish. Through shared enjoyment, people from diverse cultures can find common ground and develop friendships.
> 
> Moreover, music often reflects shared human experiences such as love, loss, and hope, which resonate with listeners of all ages. Classical compositions by composers like Beethoven or Mozart continue to move audiences centuries after they were written. Meanwhile, modern genres such as pop, rock, and hip-hop also gain international followings, connecting younger generations worldwide. In both cases, people from different age groups can bond over their mutual appreciation for a particular style or artist.
> 
> Finally, music plays an essential role in social gatherings and festivals. Events like concerts and music festivals create spaces where strangers become united through collective singing and dancing. Such experiences foster a sense of community and can help break down prejudices or misconceptions about other cultures.
> 
> In conclusion, music is indeed a powerful tool for bringing together people from various cultural and age groups. Its universal appeal, emotional impact, and social function allow individuals to connect on a deeper level, demonstrating that what unites us is often stronger than what divides us.

**范文亮点**：  
1. **清晰的段落结构**：引言—主体段—结论；  
2. **充分的例证**：提及 K-pop、拉丁音乐、古典音乐等，具有说服力；  
3. **多样化的衔接词和表达**：如 *to begin with, moreover, finally, in conclusion*；
