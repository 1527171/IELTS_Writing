Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.

In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make?

Has this become a positive or negative development?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

In previous period, people communicated with others only in a limited field. If they considered to contact with  people who in a further remote place,they had to use massage or letter and must costed lots of time. However, at present, with the technological change, internet and electronic product were developed promptly and people can use variety of intelligent devices such as mobile phone and computer to talk with friends easily,even if they are in far apart. In my opinion, I oppose this development is benefit for us.

Modern communication equipment gives a chance to connect people immediately and also make friends with people from all over the world. This invention gives us more convenience in our daily life: we can send email or message by phone if we have something wrong and can't attend a work or study. Furthermore, we can associate with friends in different cultures and  improve harmony around the world.

However, this technology also has more drawbacks.Firstly, it may declines our talking level in real world and suppress our offline social interactions. People who rely on electronic equipment extremely  are prefer staying the home and rejecting join in social life.In instance, More and more Japanese young people are selecting stay in the room all times and unwilling find a job due to they don't need talk with others and also can obtain satisfaction in online talking.Secondly, the number of criminals use chat software to cheat victims to make friends and hurt their interest. In China, there are many news about people are deceived to lose money or even lose life and government has to issue policies to prevent these events happening.Finally, it also reduces our fitness because of long time to stare the screen. Our eyesight will become bad and induce some chronic diseases like high blood pressure.

In summary,  this technology saves our time because we can establish a connection to other instantly.But we also need strengthen identify skill to distinguish the authenticity of information and control time in that.

## 二、6.5–7 分范文（英文，供模仿）

> **Question:**  
> *Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?*
>
> **Model Answer:**  
> In recent decades, advances in technology have fundamentally altered how individuals form and maintain relationships. On the one hand, online communication tools such as social media, messaging apps and video calls have made it easier than ever to connect with friends and family across the globe. For example, expatriates can maintain daily contact with relatives through WhatsApp or Skype, fostering emotional closeness despite physical distance. Moreover, technology enables people to meet new friends who share niche interests via online forums and communities, broadening their social circles beyond local boundaries.
>
> On the other hand, this digitized interaction has some drawbacks. First, online relationships often lack the depth and nonverbal cues of face‑to‑face communication, which can lead to misunderstandings or superficial bonds. Second, excessive use of social media may reduce real‑world social skills and discourage in‑person gatherings. Studies in Japan have shown that some young people become “hikikomori” (shut‑ins), preferring online chat to any offline interaction, which can harm mental health and social development.
>
> In my view, the overall impact of technology on relationships is mixed but potentially positive if used wisely. While it offers unprecedented convenience and the opportunity to connect with diverse individuals, we must deliberately balance online and offline interactions. Encouraging people to schedule regular face‑to‑face meetings and digital‑detox periods can help preserve the authenticity and emotional richness of human relationships.
