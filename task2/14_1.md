## **Revised Essay**

Some people believe that the most urgent environmental issue today is the gradual decline of certain plant and animal species. Others, however, argue that there are more critical environmental challenges that require immediate attention. In my opinion, while preventing the loss of biodiversity is crucial, other factors—such as pollution, overhunting, and unsustainable development—are equally or even more pressing, as they often directly contribute to species extinction.

On the one hand, many individuals stress the importance of protecting wildlife. A reduction in the variety of plants and animals can disrupt entire ecosystems, leading to imbalances in the food chain and threatening human survival in the long term. Furthermore, once a species becomes extinct, it cannot be recovered, which is a permanent loss to both nature and humanity. Hence, advocates of this view believe that safeguarding biodiversity should be the top priority.

On the other hand, critics highlight that other environmental concerns—like industrial emissions, deforestation, and the overuse of natural resources—are at the core of these ecological problems. Factories releasing toxic substances into the air and water significantly damage the environment, harming not only wildlife but also human health. Excessive development, such as clearing forests for agriculture or mining, disrupts natural habitats and leads to soil erosion, floods, and landslides. Meanwhile, illegal hunting for profit or sport severely depletes certain animal populations, accelerating their decline. Tackling these broader issues can help address species loss more effectively because it targets the root causes of environmental degradation.

In my assessment, although protecting endangered species is essential, addressing the underlying factors—such as pollution, habitat destruction, and unsustainable human activities—will have a more profound impact. By reducing emissions, enforcing stricter regulations, and promoting responsible resource management, we can simultaneously preserve ecosystems and prevent further loss of biodiversity.

## **Estimated IELTS Band Score: 5.5 – 6.0**

Below is a breakdown of how this essay might be evaluated according to the four IELTS Writing criteria:

1. **Task Achievement (TA): 6**  
   - You discuss both views and give your opinion.  
   - To improve further, include more **specific examples** or data to illustrate your points, and ensure each viewpoint is developed with equal depth.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion (CC): 6**  
   - The essay is structured logically (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion).  
   - You can strengthen coherence by adding clearer transitions (e.g., *“Furthermore,” “Moreover,” “In addition,”*) between supporting points.

3. **Lexical Resource (LR): 5 – 6**  
   - You use some appropriate vocabulary (e.g., *“biodiversity,” “pollution,” “ecosystems”*).  
   - However, there are occasional inaccuracies or awkward phrasing in the original draft. Continue expanding your range of academic words and practice using them in context.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA): 5 – 6**  
   - The revised version corrects many grammatical issues, but in your original draft, there were multiple errors (missing articles, incorrect verb forms, run-on sentences).  
   - Aim for a mix of simple and complex sentences while maintaining accuracy. Proofread carefully for errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, and punctuation.

## **Key Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Use More Specific Examples**  
   - Strengthen your arguments by referring to concrete examples, such as a well-known case of pollution or deforestation.

2. **Enhance Cohesion**  
   - Use linking words and phrases (e.g., *“Furthermore,” “Consequently,” “As a result,” “On the other hand,”*) to connect ideas smoothly.

3. **Expand Your Vocabulary**  
   - Incorporate a wider range of academic words and collocations (e.g., *“ecosystem imbalance,” “natural habitat destruction,” “conservation efforts,” “regulatory frameworks”*).

4. **Improve Grammar and Sentence Structure**  
   - Practice using both simple and complex sentences.  
   - Check for consistent use of articles (*“the,” “a,” “an”*), plural forms, and verb tenses.

By applying these tips consistently, you can increase the clarity and sophistication of your writing, potentially raising your IELTS Writing score to **Band 6.5 or 7**. Good luck with your preparation!

## **How to Use This Table**

1. **Read the Original Sentence** and compare it with the **Revised Sentence** to see the changes.
2. Check the **Correction Reason** column for explanations of each error. Pay attention to grammar (tense, article usage), vocabulary (word choice), and clarity (sentence structure, coherence).
3. **Practice** rewriting similar sentences on your own to reinforce these corrections and avoid repeating the same mistakes in future essays.  

By focusing on each type of error—grammar, vocabulary, structure—you can gradually improve your writing skills and aim for a higher band score. Good luck with your studies!
