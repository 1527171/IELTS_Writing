There is a debate about whether decline the working time and extend weekend. In my assessment, I partially agree with the improve resting time for workers. This essay will explain my opinions.
﻿
On the one hand, longer leisure has many advantages for workers. Firstly,this quotas can make workers more relaxed. It can provide more time to recover the energy which consume in work time and also can finish work efficiently. In addition, it can offer time to do somethings interesting.They can have a trip or go fishing, whether what they do if they fond it. Secondly, it can have more time to accompany with their families. There kids will get more attention and enhance their confidence due to their parents have time to expand the kids' view. Besides, it also reinforce the family relationship. Thirdly, workers have more time to study other knowledge to gain better occupation with high salary. They can fully use the leisure time to master more skills and find more suitable work to strengthen their economic level. 
﻿
On the other hand, further time to rest may cause worker can't earn more money to maintain household expenses. They will gain less salary compare with former time because of less time to work. They have to find several works to earn enough money, which will expend more time to work,and even have less time to break than previous time.
﻿
In summary, having a longer weekend can give worker more free time to do what they prefer with.Whereas it also should pay attention to improve their salary as same as enhance leisure time.

**题目：**  
*The working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend. Do you agree or disagree?*  

### **Revised Essay:**  

There is an ongoing debate about whether the working week should be shortened, allowing employees to have longer weekends. In my opinion, I **partially agree** with this idea, as extending rest time can benefit both workers and their families, but it may also lead to financial drawbacks.  

On the one hand, a shorter working week brings several advantages. Firstly, having **more time to rest** helps employees recover from work-related fatigue, improving their overall productivity. For example, countries like Sweden and Iceland have experimented with shorter workweeks, and studies show that workers became more efficient while maintaining or even increasing productivity levels. Secondly, extended weekends allow people to spend **quality time with their families**, which is essential for maintaining strong relationships. Parents can engage more in their children's education, boosting their confidence and emotional well-being. Lastly, a reduced workweek enables employees to **pursue personal growth**, such as learning new skills or engaging in hobbies, which may enhance their career prospects in the long run.  

On the other hand, reducing work hours might lead to **financial concerns** for some employees. A shorter working week often means lower salaries unless companies adjust wages accordingly. This could create financial pressure, particularly for low-income workers who **struggle to meet household expenses**. Additionally, some industries require continuous operations, such as healthcare and public services, making it difficult to implement a uniform shorter workweek without disrupting essential functions.  

In conclusion, while a shorter workweek offers significant **physical, emotional, and professional** benefits, financial concerns and industry requirements must be considered. A **balanced approach**—such as flexible work schedules or higher hourly wages—could be a better alternative to ensure both economic stability and work-life balance.
