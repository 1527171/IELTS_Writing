Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.



Because the development of society and support by the government, more and more students are allowed to study in universities. However, students' gender in different majors are usually imbalanced in every university.Some individuals argue that colleges should accept equal number of male and female students in every subject. While others disagree. In my assessment, I incomplete agree the former's approach. In this paper, I will explain the reasons to prove my opinion.

The figure of male and female students are different in some subjects may cause gender proportion of talents in related fields severe disorder. For instance,  female teacher in China are showing a dramatic increase, and induce school more prefer to employ male teachers.This problem is unfair for female.

However, if this equal policy is passed, it also make some problems. Firstly, selecting a major is refer from the interesting of students. They may make the study motivate decline when they are admitted to a major that I don't like.Meanwhile, it will also cause a decrease in study atmosphere. Secondly, some majors are more suitable to male or female such as engineer or flight attendant. Because students in engine major often need consume a lot of energy and the working environment may be harsh. Furthermore, stewardess  in flight or train are more popular for passengers, they are more patience and careful than men.

In summary, Although equal distribution by gender seem fair for every students, it also cause some students loss there interesting major and unreasonable employment direction.

## 二、更优范文示例

> **题目：**  
> *Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

### **范文：**

There is a debate about whether universities should admit the same number of male and female students in every subject. While ensuring gender equality is important, I believe that enforcing strict quotas in each course may not be the most effective approach.

On the one hand, promoting equal gender representation can help eliminate bias and ensure fairness. In many fields, such as teaching or nursing, the majority of students tend to be female, which may create stereotypes and limit career opportunities for men. By accepting an equal number of males and females, universities could encourage diversity, which often leads to a more balanced and inclusive learning environment. Additionally, students of both genders may benefit from interacting with peers who offer different perspectives and problem-solving approaches.

On the other hand, rigidly enforcing gender quotas in every subject can be counterproductive. First, student choice should be respected; individuals usually select majors based on their interests and strengths, and forcing them into courses purely to fulfill a quota could reduce motivation and lead to poorer academic performance. Second, certain subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender. For example, engineering programs often appeal to men, while early childhood education might be more popular among women. Imposing strict numerical requirements could result in universities admitting candidates who are less enthusiastic or less qualified, simply to meet gender targets.

In conclusion, although striving for gender balance is a worthy goal, I do not believe that universities should enforce equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. A more flexible approach that respects individual preferences and maintains academic standards is likely to be more beneficial in the long run.

### **写作提升建议**

1. **结构清晰**  
   - 建议采用四段式：**引言（表达立场）—主体段 1（同意理由）—主体段 2（不同意理由）—结论（重申观点）**。

2. **论证充分**  
   - 提出观点后要有足够的论据或实例来支撑。可结合现实例子，如 STEM 专业男女比例差异、护理专业男生比例较低等。

3. **语言准确度**  
   - 注意动词时态、主谓一致及代词使用；  
   - 减少中式表达，多用地道短语（*gender balance, academic interests, personal preferences, enforce quotas* 等）。

4. **段落衔接**  
   - 使用 **“On the one hand, On the other hand, Moreover, Consequently, Therefore”** 等连接词，使思路更加连贯。

# 六个板块的句型整理（基于大学是否应按性别平衡招生的辩论文章）

**一、引言句型**  
- *"There is a debate about whether [topic]. While [acknowledgment of importance], I believe that [personal stance]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"There is a debate about whether universities should admit the same number of male and female students in every subject. While ensuring gender equality is important, I believe that enforcing strict quotas in each course may not be the most effective approach."*  
  (关于大学是否应在各科目中按性别平衡招生存在争议。虽然确保性别平等很重要，但我认为在每个课程中强制执行严格的性别配额可能不是最有效的方法。)

---

**二、支持论点句型**  
- *"On the one hand, [argument supporting gender equality]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"On the one hand, promoting equal gender representation can help eliminate bias and ensure fairness, especially in fields where one gender tends to dominate."*  
  (一方面，促进性别平衡可以帮助消除偏见并确保公平，特别是在某些领域中某一性别占主导地位的情况下。)

---

**三、举例说明句型**  
- *"For example, in many fields such as [subject], [situation] may lead to [outcome]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"For example, in fields like teaching or nursing, the majority of students tend to be female, which may reinforce stereotypes and limit career opportunities for men."*  
  (例如，在教学或护理等领域，大部分学生往往为女性，这可能强化刻板印象并限制男性的职业机会。)

- *"Additionally, [benefit of diversity]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Additionally, having an equal mix of genders can foster a more balanced and inclusive learning environment where students benefit from diverse perspectives."*  
  (此外，男女比例均衡能营造出更加平衡和包容的学习环境，使学生从多元化的视角中获益。)

---

**四、反方观点句型**  
- *"On the other hand, [argument against strict quotas]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"On the other hand, rigidly enforcing gender quotas in every subject can be counterproductive."*  
  (另一方面，在每个科目中严格执行性别配额可能适得其反。)

- *"For instance, [explanation of potential negative impact]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"For instance, forcing students into courses solely to meet a quota might reduce their motivation and lead to poorer academic performance, as individuals usually choose majors based on their interests and strengths."*  
  (例如，为了满足配额而强迫学生选择课程可能会降低他们的积极性，并导致较差的学术表现，因为学生通常会根据自己的兴趣和优势来选择专业。)

---

**五、反驳及说明句型**  
- *"Moreover, [further explanation of why strict quotas are problematic]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Moreover, certain subjects naturally attract more students of one gender; imposing strict quotas might compel universities to admit candidates who are less enthusiastic or less qualified simply to meet the numbers."*  
  (此外，某些学科本身就自然吸引了更多某一性别的学生；强制配额可能迫使大学仅为满足人数要求而录取那些热情或资质较低的考生。)

- *"Therefore, [suggestion for a more flexible approach]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Therefore, rather than enforcing rigid quotas, universities should adopt a more flexible approach that respects individual choices while still striving for overall gender balance."*  
  (因此，与其强制执行僵化的配额，大学更应采取一种既尊重个人选择又努力实现总体性别平衡的灵活策略。)

---

**六、结论句型**  
- *"In conclusion, although [acknowledgment of the importance of the goal], I do not believe that [restate personal stance]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"In conclusion, although striving for gender balance is a worthy goal, I do not believe that universities should enforce equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. A more flexible approach that respects individual preferences and maintains academic standards is likely to be more beneficial in the long run."*  
  (总之，尽管追求性别平衡是一个值得追求的目标，但我不认为大学应该在每个科目中强制男女生人数相等。采用更为灵活的方法，既尊重个人偏好又保持学术标准，长期来看更可能带来益处。)
