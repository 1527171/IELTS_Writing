The diagram presents a method that produce power by an equipment named hydroelectric power station. This station utilizes the height difference and generates electricity by sharply streaming water.

The structure of  the station including two parts.In the higher location, there is a river provides water resource continunally and stores the water by a dam, then formed a  high-level reservoir.In the lower location, there is a power station connects with low-level reservoir .The power was generated in this station and then transmits to national grid by power lines. Water can flow from high-level reservoir to the station or vice versa with a channel.

During the day time, the intake under the dam will be opened, flow the water from the channel to power station and participate in generate electricity. In power station, the water goes through the reversible turbines and spins it, then uses this energy assist to operate generator and creates power.The power can flow to power lines and then arrives national grid.The water discharges to the low-level reservoir.While during the night, water in low-level reservoir will be recycled, reversible turbines will pump water to channel and finally into the high-level reservoir.

## 一、最终评分

**IELTS 写作任务 1 预估分数：5.5 – 6.0 分左右**

- **任务完成（Task Achievement）：6**  
  你描述了图表的主要流程，基本涵盖了“白天发电、夜间抽水”的关键信息。但在某些细节（如具体阐述水流方向、进水口/出水口的运作）上可以更清晰，且需注意词汇与表达的准确度。

- **连贯与衔接（Coherence and Cohesion）：6**  
  文章结构大致分段合理（介绍、主体、补充说明），但段落衔接和逻辑衔接词可进一步加强，使阅读更加顺畅。

- **词汇资源（Lexical Resource）：5–6**  
  词汇总体能表达大意，但部分用词存在搭配或拼写问题（如 “continunally”、“generate power by an equipment” 等），可多积累描述工艺流程的词汇与短语，如 “the flow of water,” “reservoir,” “intake gate,” “outflow,” “reversible turbines” 等。

- **语法多样性与准确性（Grammatical Range and Accuracy）：5**  
  句式中存在多处时态、主谓一致、用词搭配等方面的错误；部分句子较为口语化或结构不完整，需加强对复杂句和被动语态的使用。

综合来看，你对水力发电流程有大体的描述能力，但在用词准确度和句式规范性上还需提升。

## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇经过修改后的范例作文，供你参考。此版本在结构、词汇和句式上更符合雅思写作要求。请注意，文字仅供参考，你应结合自身理解和风格进行学习与借鉴。

> **Hydroelectric Power Station**
> 
> The diagram illustrates how electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station by **taking advantage of** water flow between a high-level reservoir and a low-level reservoir.  
> 
> Overall, the process involves using the force of water flowing downhill during the day to drive turbines and produce electricity, while at night, water is pumped back to the upper reservoir for reuse.  
> 
> During the daytime, the intake gate at the dam is opened, allowing water from the high-level reservoir to flow through the penstock and turn the reversible turbines. This spinning motion powers the generator, producing electricity that is then transmitted to the national grid via power lines. After passing through the turbines, the water collects in the low-level reservoir.  
> 
> At night, the direction of flow is reversed. The turbines operate as pumps, using electricity from the national grid to move water back from the low-level reservoir to the high-level reservoir. This cycle ensures that there is always sufficient water at a higher elevation for power generation during the next day.

## 四、总结

1. **评分与作文提升：**  
   你对图表主要内容的概括和流程描述基本到位，但应加强用词准确度和句子结构的严谨性。写过程图时，通常使用一般现在时和被动语态描述流程，并注意衔接词的运用。

2. **改错表格：**  
   上表详细列出了你在词汇、语法、表达方面出现的问题，并给出了修改建议。请逐条对照，并在后续写作中刻意避免类似错误。

3. **模仿与练习：**  
   参考“更优作文范例”，多做类似流程图、地图题的练习，熟悉常用词汇（如 reservoir, intake gate, penstock, turbine, generator, discharge 等），并加强被动语态及复杂句的运用。

只要不断练习并留意细节，相信你的写作水平一定会稳步提升，祝你学习顺利！
