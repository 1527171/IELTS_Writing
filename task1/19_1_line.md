## 二、整体评分与理由

根据雅思写作 Task 1 的四项评分标准（Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy），可以对你的作文进行如下评估：

1. **任务完成度（Task Achievement）：6 分左右**  
   - 你大体涵盖了主要活动的数据和趋势，能够描述出各活动从 2000 到 2020 的变化情况。  
   - 需要进一步突出“整体对比”与“最明显的几个变化”来提高得分。

2. **连贯与衔接（Coherence and Cohesion）：5–6 分**  
   - 文章整体有序，但部分句子衔接稍显生硬，需要更多衔接词和过渡短语（例如：However, Meanwhile, By contrast, In addition, Finally 等）来保证段落内部及段落之间的逻辑流畅。

3. **词汇资源（Lexical Resource）：5–6 分**  
   - 有些地方用词或表达不够准确或存在拼写、搭配错误（例如：experience a obviously growth → experienced a clear increase；None of people join → no one joined）。  
   - 建议多注意常见描述趋势的词汇，如：**rise slightly, drop steadily, remain stable, peak at** 等。

4. **语法多样性与准确性（Grammatical Range and Accuracy）：5 分**  
   - 存在一些基础语法错误（主谓一致、时态、冠词等），例如 “the number of martial arts was remain stable” 应改为 “the number of martial arts participants remained stable。”  
   - 需加强对被动语态、时态一致性以及名词单复数的掌握。

**综合预估：5.5 – 6.0 分**  
要想达到 6.5 甚至更高，需要减少语法错误、在用词上更准确、并使文章结构更加清晰连贯。

### **提升建议**

1. **段落结构**  
   - 可以考虑 3-4 段：**引言**（概述图表、点明整体趋势）→ **主体段 1**（描述最突出的活动或几种趋势）→ **主体段 2**（描述剩余活动）→ **总结**（简要总结主要变化）。

2. **使用更多衔接词**  
   - 例如：**“However,” “In contrast,” “Meanwhile,” “As a result,” “Overall,”** 等，让行文更顺畅。

3. **关注数据与时态**  
   - 如果某数据是“过去到现在”或“过去到将来”，请使用合适的时态。但本题都是过去到 2020 年，建议用一般过去时或描述趋势时的现在完成时都可以，但要前后统一。

4. **多样化的描述趋势**  
   - 避免一直使用 “increased” 或 “decreased”，可换用 **“rose, climbed, grew, fell, dropped, declined, remained stable, fluctuated”** 等词汇。
