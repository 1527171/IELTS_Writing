The bar chart illustrates the amount of minutes of telephone calls divided into three categories in the UK between 1995 and 2002.Overall, telephone calls by local showed a decreasing trend.In addition, calls by national and international and mobiles went up over the total period.

It is clear that telephone calls by local was the biggest share in three categories between 1995 and 2002.Followed by national and international, then was mobiles.The number of minutes of telephone calls by local experienced a steady increased and reached around 90 billion,it subsequently slightly declined by 1999 onward and reached nearly 70 billion by 2002. Whereas telephone calls by national and international remained slowly climb and reached nearly 60 billion by 2002. By contrast, telephone calls by mobiles showed a sharp increase after a  gradual growth in 2015 and reached around 40 billion by 2002.

In summary, the demand of telephone calls by national and international and mobiles presented went up, while telephone calls by local decreased gradually,although it still in high levels in the UK.

## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇结构更清晰、语言更准确的示例作文，供你参考。你可结合自身理解和风格进行适当调整。

> **题目：**  
> *The chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in the UK, divided into three categories, from 1995—2002. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*
>
> **范文：**  
> The bar chart compares the total number of minutes (in billions) of three types of telephone calls—local, national and international, and mobile—in the UK between 1995 and 2002. **Overall**, local calls consistently accounted for the highest volume, despite a decline after 1999, while both national and international calls and mobile calls increased throughout the period.
>
> In **1995**, local calls stood at around 72 billion minutes, rising steadily to a peak of approximately 90 billion in **1999**. After that, the figure gradually decreased, ending at about 70 billion minutes in **2002**. Nevertheless, local calls remained the most widely used form of communication over the entire timeframe.
>
> Meanwhile, national and international calls started at roughly 38 billion minutes in **1995** and grew steadily each year, reaching nearly 60 billion by **2002**. Although their overall rise was not as dramatic as that of mobile calls, this category showed consistent growth.  
>
> By contrast, mobile calls began at just over 3 billion minutes in **1995**, making them the least popular option initially. After a relatively slow increase until **1998**, usage rose sharply, hitting around 12 billion minutes in **1999** and soaring to nearly 40 billion by **2002**.
>
> **In summary**, local calls remained the most common type of telephone communication in the UK, even though they declined after 1999. Meanwhile, both national and international calls and mobile calls experienced steady or rapid growth, with mobile calls showing the most significant increase overall.

**范文亮点**：  
1. **结构清晰**：分段介绍三种通话类型，分别描述起始数值、变化趋势、最终数值；结尾段总结要点。  
2. **用词精准**：如 *stood at around, peaked at, grew steadily, soared to* 等词汇准确表达数据变化。  
3. **衔接自然**：使用 *Overall, Meanwhile, By contrast, In summary* 等连接词，行文流畅。

### **使用建议**

1. **数据描述准确性**  
   - 注意年份、数值和趋势（如先上升后下降），避免与图表不符；  
   - 给出大约值时使用 *about, approximately, around* 等词。

2. **丰富趋势词汇**  
   - 多使用 *increased steadily, rose slightly, peaked at, declined gradually* 等词汇，避免过度使用 “went up” 或 “fell”。

3. **句式多样性**  
   - 尝试用从句、分词结构或被动语态（如 *After reaching a peak of…*）来丰富表达；  
   - 保持时态一致（一般过去时描述过去数据、一般现在时或将来时描述预测）。
