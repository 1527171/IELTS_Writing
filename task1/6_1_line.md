The line chart illustrates the information about global water use by agriculture, industrial use and domestic use.And table presents the water consumption in two different countries in 2000. Overall, the global water consumption by three sectors rose steadily between 1900 and 2000.

In 1900,  the most part of water use was agriculture, at nearly 500 km3. While industrial and domestic use shared in low figure,at less 100 km3. The water consumption experienced a gradual growth until in 1950, the figure subsequently increased dramatically compare with the past time.Finally, in 2000, the water use in agriculture reached 3000 km3, followed by industrial, at over 1000 km3, and domestic use just at 400 km3.

It is clear that Brazil was used more water than Democractic Republic of Congo in 2000. The population of Brazil was 176 million and nearly 30 times larger than Conga(5.2 million). But Brazil utilized more water resources than Congo,which water use in irrigated land was over ten thousand times than Congo,at 26500 km2 and 100 m2 respectively, and  daily average water usage was 40 times than Congo, at 259 m3 and 8 m3 respectively.

## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇条理更清晰、用词更准确的示例作文，供你参考。你可结合自身理解和风格进行调整和学习。

> **题目：**  
> *The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.*
> 
> **范文：**  
> The line chart compares global water use in three sectors—agriculture, industry, and domestic—from 1900 to 2000, while the table provides data on water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Overall, worldwide water use rose significantly over the century in all three sectors, and Brazil had a much higher water consumption than Congo in 2000.
> 
> From 1900 to around 1950, agricultural water use grew gradually from about 500 cubic kilometres to nearly 1,000. After 1950, it increased more dramatically, reaching around 3,000 cubic kilometres by 2000. Industrial water use and domestic water use remained relatively low until the mid-20th century, after which they both started to climb more steeply. By 2000, industrial water use stood at just over 1,000 cubic kilometres, whereas domestic water use was approximately 400.
> 
> Turning to the table, Brazil’s population was 176 million in 2000, compared with only 5.2 million in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Brazil also had a far larger area of irrigated land (26,500 km²) than Congo (100 km²). Consequently, its water consumption per person reached 359 m³, which is significantly higher than Congo’s figure of just 8 m³ per person.
> 
> In summary, while all three sectors experienced growth in global water usage, agriculture dominated overall consumption. Moreover, Brazil’s vastly larger population and irrigated land area contributed to its substantially higher water use compared with the Democratic Republic of Congo.

**范文亮点：**  
1. **结构清晰**：分段介绍折线图（全球用水）与表格（两国对比）。  
2. **用词准确**：如 *cubic kilometres, irrigated land, per person, significantly higher*。  
3. **衔接自然**：使用 *Turning to the table, Consequently, In summary* 等衔接词让行文更顺畅。

Its irrigated land area was 26,500 km² compared to only 100 km² in Congo, and its per capita water usage was also significantly higher.”                                                                                           |
| **7.** “The population of Brazil was 176 million and nearly 30 times larger than Conga(5.2 million) … daily average water usage was 40 times than Congo, at 259 m3 and 8 m3.” | 1. “Conga”应为 “Congo”；<br>2. 原表格显示巴西人均用水 359 m³，而非 259 m³；<br>3. “40 times than Congo”可改为 “40 times that of Congo”；<br>4. 注意区分数据来源并保持一致性。                                                                                                                           | “Brazil’s population was 176 million, roughly 34 times that of Congo (5.2 million), and its per capita water usage (359 m³) was over 40 times higher than Congo’s 8 m³.”                                                                                                                          |

### 学习与改进建议

1. **数据准确性**  
   - 引用表格和图表数据时务必核对数字，避免出现“259 m³”与表格“359 m³”不符的情况。  
   - 使用倍数或差值表达时，也要确保和原数据相符。

2. **用词与句式**  
   - 练习多种表达数据变化的方式（*rose significantly, climbed gradually, remained stable, reached a peak of…* 等），并注意句子之间的衔接。  
   - 注意地名、单位等的拼写与一致性（如 *Congo*, *km²*, *m³*）。

3. **段落结构**  
   - 先整体概括（Overall），再分段详细描述折线图和表格中的主要信息。  
   - 段落内可先描述最主要/最高或最低的数据，再进行其他细节或对比。

通过不断练习、注意细节并改正上述问题，你的写作水平一定会稳步提高。祝你学习顺利并取得好成绩！
