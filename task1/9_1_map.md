## 二、更优范文示例

> **题目：**  
> *The two maps below show an island, before and after the construction of some tourist facilities. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*

**范文：**

The maps compare an island before and after the construction of tourist facilities. **Overall**, the island was initially undeveloped, with only a beach on the western side and a few palm trees scattered around. After development, new structures such as accommodations, a reception, a restaurant, and a pier were added, providing access for visitors.

In the **original** layout, the island was surrounded by sea and had no buildings. A beach was located on the west, and several palm trees were distributed across the island. By **contrast**, the **redeveloped** island now features a pier on the southern coast, allowing boats to dock. A reception building has been constructed in the centre, with a footpath connecting it to a restaurant in the north.

Meanwhile, two clusters of accommodation huts have been built: one to the west of the reception and another to the east, both linked by footpaths. From the western huts, visitors can walk to the beach, which is now designated as a swimming area. The eastern side of the island remains largely undeveloped, preserving its natural environment.

In summary, the island has undergone significant development to cater to tourists, with newly added amenities such as accommodations, a restaurant, and a pier, while still retaining some untouched areas on its eastern side.

## 四、写作提升建议

1. **地图题写作思路**  
   - **第一段**：简要介绍地图主题（前后对比），指出主要变化；  
   - **第二、三段**：按方位（或变化顺序）详细描述新增/变动的设施；  
   - **结尾**：可简要总结整体变化或保留原貌的区域。

2. **地图题常用词汇**  
   - **位置**：on the western/eastern side, in the centre, at the southern tip, along the coast  
   - **方向**：north, south, east, west, northeast, southwest  
   - **变化**：was built/constructed, replaced, expanded, demolished, remains unchanged  

3. **逻辑与衔接**  
   - 使用连接词（*Meanwhile, By contrast, In addition, After that*）使句子衔接更流畅；  
   - 一段只讨论一个主题，如“新建筑设施”、“交通通道”、“未开发区域”等。

# 六个板块的句型整理（基于岛屿旅游设施开发地图）
