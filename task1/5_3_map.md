## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇结构更清晰、信息更全面的示例作文，供你参考。你可结合自身思路进行调整和学习。

> **题目：**  
> *The map below is of the town of Garlsdon. A new supermarket (S) is planned for the town. The map shows two possible sites for the supermarket. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*
>
> **范文：**  
> The map depicts the town of Garlsdon, which has a population of 65,000, along with two proposed locations (S1 and S2) for a new supermarket. Overall, S1 is situated in the countryside to the northwest, whereas S2 lies in the town centre, which is designated as a no-traffic zone.  
> 
> In terms of **geography**, Garlsdon is encircled by countryside, with most residential areas surrounding the central no-traffic zone. There are also two industrial zones: one in the north and another in the south. A railway line crosses the town from northwest to southeast, connecting Hindon (12 km away, population 10,000) and Cransdon (25 km away, population 29,000). Meanwhile, main roads lead to Bransdon in the southeast (16 km away, population 15,000).  
> 
> Regarding the **potential sites**, **S1** lies just outside the town boundary on the road toward Hindon. It is also close to the railway line, suggesting convenient access for people traveling from the northwest. Since it is in the countryside, it is not restricted by the no-traffic zone, which might benefit customers driving from outside Garlsdon.  
> 
> By contrast, **S2** is located within the town centre. Although this could attract many local residents, it falls inside the no-traffic zone, potentially limiting car access. However, being near the railway and surrounded by housing may still draw a large number of shoppers, including those arriving by public transport.  
> 
> In summary, S1’s countryside location may offer better road access from neighboring towns, while S2’s position in the no-traffic zone could appeal to central residents and train commuters.

### **使用建议**

1. **地图题写作思路**  
   - **第一段**：概括地图主题、指出主要特征（如人口、主要分区）。  
   - **第二段**：描述整体布局（如镇中心、工业区、住房区、铁路、公路等），并简要提及周边城市。  
   - **第三段**：对比两个选址（S1、S2）的具体位置和可能影响。  
   - **结尾总结**：概括各选址的优劣或主要区别。

2. **用词与句式**  
   - 多使用地图题常用词汇（*located, situated, lies to the north/south, accessible via main roads, railway line*）。  
   - 注意被动语态和从句结构（*which is, where it is, that leads to*）使表达更地道。

3. **逻辑与衔接**  
   - 使用连接词（*Furthermore, Meanwhile, By contrast*）让句子之间逻辑清晰；  
   - 一段只讨论一个主题点，如“地理布局”、“交通”、“选址差异”等。
