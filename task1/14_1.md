the bar chart and table illustrate the benefit of various export cargo and the change of proportion of every export category comparing 2015 and 2016.


According to the bar chart, we can clearly see that  petroleum products and engineered goods both in similar level, which possessed the most proportion in export earnings in 2015 and 2016. Followed by gems and jewellery, which earned 40 billions approximately by export in 2015 and 2016.Then agricultural products and textiles both  in a relatively small portion, averaged in 30 billions.


According to the table, it can be seen apparently that income of export gems and jewellery was the only one droped trend in 5 products, at decreased 5.18%.Other products all show different degrees of growth.Among then, textiles was the highest boost than others,at 15.24%. However, agricultural products was the lowest enhance,at 0.81%.Finally, except with petroleum products(which only raised in 3%), engineered goods was the only one who growth exceed 5%, at 8.5%.


Overall, the figure of export volume and economic benefit in this region showing an upward trend,only a few types of products decreased.

Below is a revised version of your report, followed by an approximate IELTS band score evaluation and explanations of how to improve it further.

## **Revised Report**

The bar chart compares the export earnings (in billions of dollars) from five product categories—petroleum products, engineered goods, gems and jewelry, agricultural products, and textiles—in 2015 and 2016. The accompanying table shows the percentage change in the value of each export category over the same period.

Overall, petroleum products and engineered goods generated the highest earnings in both years, at roughly **\(60+ billion\)**. Gems and jewelry followed, at about **\(40 billion\)** in 2015 and 2016, while agricultural products and textiles brought in smaller amounts, at around **\(30 billion or less\)**.

Regarding percentage changes, gems and jewelry was the only category that declined, falling by **5.18%**. In contrast, all other categories experienced growth. Textiles had the largest increase, rising by **15.24%**, whereas agricultural products grew by just **0.81%**, the smallest gain. Petroleum products recorded a modest increase of **3%**, while engineered goods rose by **8.5%**.

In summary, most export categories in this region showed an upward trend in both value and percentage growth, with the notable exception of gems and jewelry, which declined slightly between 2015 and 2016.

## **Estimated IELTS Band Score: 6 – 6.5**

Here is a breakdown of how your report measures up to the IELTS Writing Task 1 criteria:

1. **Task Achievement (TA): 6–7**  
   - You cover the main trends and provide key figures from both the bar chart and the table.  
   - To score higher, ensure you include **all** significant details (e.g., approximate numerical data for each category) and maintain a clear overview of the trends.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion (CC): 6**  
   - The revised version flows well, with clear paragraphing (introduction, body, and summary).  
   - To improve, use more linking words (e.g., *“Meanwhile,” “In contrast,” “Furthermore”*) consistently to show relationships between points.

3. **Lexical Resource (LR): 6**  
   - The vocabulary is adequate and mostly accurate.  
   - You can aim for more varied word choices (e.g., “rose,” “increased,” “grew,” “climbed,” etc.) to avoid repetition.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA): 5–6**  
   - The revised report corrects many grammatical errors from the original.  
   - Watch out for subject-verb agreement (*“products were,” “textiles brought in”*) and articles (*“the value,” “a decline”*).  
   - Aim to reduce minor errors and refine sentence structures to improve clarity.

### **Key Improvements Made**

1. **Introduction and Overview**  
   - **Original:** “the bar chart and table illustrate the benefit of various export cargo...”  
   - **Revised:** “The bar chart compares the export earnings (in billions of dollars) from five product categories...”  
   - **Reason:** Using “compare” and “export earnings” is more precise and academic.

2. **Clear Data Reporting**  
   - **Original:** “petroleum products and engineered goods both in similar level...”  
   - **Revised:** “petroleum products and engineered goods generated the highest earnings in both years, at roughly (60+ billion).”  
   - **Reason:** Provides specific figures and clear comparisons.

3. **Grammar and Vocabulary**  
   - **Original:** “income of export gems and jewellery was the only one droped trend...”  
   - **Revised:** “gems and jewelry was the only category that declined...”  
   - **Reason:** Fixes grammar (*“dropped”*), uses concise phrasing (*“was the only category that declined”*).

4. **Conclusion**  
   - **Original:** “Overall, the figure of export volume and economic benefit in this region showing an upward trend...”  
   - **Revised:** “In summary, most export categories...showed an upward trend...”  
   - **Reason:** More precise and aligns with formal report-writing style.

### **Final Tips**

- **Use Precise Language**: Replace vague words like “benefit” with “earnings” or “value.”  
- **Include Key Figures**: Mention approximate numbers to make comparisons clear.  
- **Check Grammar Carefully**: Especially articles (“a,” “the”) and verb forms.  

With these refinements, your Task 1 report becomes more coherent, detailed, and accurate, helping you aim for a **Band 7** or higher if applied consistently.
