## 二、更优范文示例

> **题目：**  
> *The maps below show the centre of a small town called Islip as it is now, and plans for its development. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*

**范文：**

The two maps illustrate the current layout of Islip town centre and the proposed changes for its future development. **Overall**, the plan involves creating a new ring road around the town, converting the existing main road into a pedestrian-only zone, and adding several facilities such as a bus station, shopping centre, and car park.

In the **existing** layout, a single main road runs east to west through the centre, lined by shops on both sides. To the south of this road are some housing areas, as well as a park in the southeast corner. A school is located further west, also to the south of the main road. On the northern side, there is countryside, and more housing extends to the east and west.

**After** redevelopment, the main road will be pedestrianized, with a dual carriageway built around the town centre to allow traffic to bypass the pedestrian zone. Several new facilities will occupy the northern side of the former main road, including a bus station, a shopping centre, and a car park. The existing shops will remain, and the park to the east will be partially replaced by new housing. Meanwhile, the southern housing area will expand slightly, but the school in the west will stay in the same location.  

In summary, these changes aim to improve accessibility and shopping options in Islip, while redirecting traffic flow around the town centre.

   - **第三段**：描述未来规划（新道路、行人专用区、新建筑等）。  
   - **结尾**：可简单总结或不写过长的结论。

2. **地图题常用词汇**  
   - **道路**：main road, ring road, dual carriageway, pedestrianized area  
   - **方位**：to the north/south/east/west, in the southeast corner, along the northern edge  
   - **变化**：converted into, replaced by, demolished, expanded, newly built, remains unchanged  

3. **语言准确性**  
   - 使用正确的时态：描述当前状态用一般现在时，描述未来规划用将来时（*will be built, will be converted*）。  
   - 多检查主谓一致和冠词（a/the），如“a footpath,” “the park,” “shops are lined along.”
