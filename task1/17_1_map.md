## **二、更优范文示例**

> **题目：**  
> *The maps below show an industrial area in the town of Norbiton, and planned future development of the site. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*

### **范文：**
The two maps illustrate the current layout of Norbiton’s industrial area and the proposed plans for its future redevelopment. **Overall**, the site will be transformed from an industrial zone into a residential area with new housing, commercial facilities, and public amenities.

At present, the area consists of several factories arranged around a circular road, which is linked to a main road running from west to east. A river flows from the northwest to the northeast, separating the industrial area from the farmland in the north.

After redevelopment, **all factories will be removed** to make space for new **housing, shops, a medical centre, a school, and a playground**. The existing ring road will remain, but a **second ring road** will be added to improve access. To the **west** of the first ring road, a **new residential area** and a **shopping centre** will be built, while a **medical centre** will be constructed to the **east**.

A **new road** will extend northwards, crossing the river via a **newly built bridge** and leading to a housing development in the farmland area. Meanwhile, in the **southeast**, a **school and a playground** will be introduced, providing additional community facilities.

In summary, this redevelopment will completely transform Norbiton’s industrial site into a modern residential district with enhanced infrastructure and public amenities.
