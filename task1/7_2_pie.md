The four pie charts illustrate the units of generation by coal,oil,natural gas,hydro power and nuclear power in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. Overall, the total production in Australia in 2000(100 units) was 70 units higher than it in 1980(170 units).While total production in France in 2000(180 units) was twice time higher than it in 1980(90 units).

In Australia, power generation by coal was biggest level in 1980,at 50 units,followed by natural gas and hydro power, which units  were all 20.The oil was the lowest share, at only 10 units.Meanwhile. Then in 2000, the proportion of coal was  increased over twice times compared with 1980, at 130 units. However, the units of electricity  by natural gas and oil were showed sharply decrease, both at 2 units. Nuclear power was never been used  in Australia.

In France, except of hydro power, other four materials were all relatively primary ways of generating electricity in 1980, accounting for 15 to 25 units.While hydro power only at 5 units. In 2000, nuclear power was the the main source to production,at 126 units.coal and oil maintained relatively stable in contrast to 1980.Thus natural gas and hydro power were dramatically reduce, both at 2 units.

In summary, generation in France became more and more environment friendly,while Australia selected more proportion in fuel source.

## 二、更优范文示例

> **题目：**  
> *The pie charts below show units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*

**范文：**

The four pie charts compare how much electricity was generated from coal, oil, natural gas, hydro power and nuclear power in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. **Overall**, both countries increased their total output, but Australia relied more heavily on coal by 2000, while France shifted dramatically towards nuclear power.

In **1980**, Australia produced a total of 100 units: coal accounted for 50 units (half of the total), natural gas and hydro power each contributed 20 units, oil supplied 10 units, and nuclear power was not used. By **2000**, total output rose to 170 units. Coal generation more than doubled to 130 units, hydro power edged up slightly to 36 units, and both oil and natural gas plunged to just 2 units each. Nuclear power remained absent.

In **France**, total production doubled from 90 units in 1980 to 180 units in 2000. In 1980, coal, natural gas and oil each generated between 20 and 25 units; nuclear power supplied 15 units, and hydro power only 5 units. By 2000, nuclear power dominated with 126 units—nearly 70% of the total. Coal and oil remained stable at 25 units apiece, while natural gas and hydro power dropped steeply to 2 units each.

**In summary**, Australia’s electricity mix became even more coal‐dependent over the two decades, whereas France underwent a major shift to nuclear energy.

## 三、详细改错表格

| **原句** | **修改原因** | **修改后** |
|:---------|:-------------|:-----------|
| 1. “Overall, the total production in Australia in 2000(100 units) was 70 units higher than it in 1980(170 units).” | 数字颠倒，写法不清晰。应先写 1980 后写 2000。 | **“Overall, total electricity production in Australia increased from 100 units in 1980 to 170 units in 2000.”** |
| 2. “While total production in France in 2000(180 units) was twice time higher than it in 1980(90 units).” | 搭配错误，“twice time higher” 应为 “twice as high” 或 “doubled”。 | **“In France, total output doubled from 90 units in 1980 to 180 units in 2000.”** |
| 3. “power generation by coal was biggest level in 1980,at 50 units” | 表达不地道，“was biggest level” 应为 “accounted for the largest share” | **“In 1980, coal accounted for the largest share in Australia at 50 units.”** |
| 4. “natural gas and hydro power, which units were all 20.” | 语序与搭配不当，应改为 “both generated 20 units”。 | **“Both natural gas and hydro power generated 20 units.”** |
| 5. “the proportion of coal was increased over twice times compared with 1980, at 130 units.” | 时态与表达错误，应为 “more than doubled” | **“By 2000, coal generation more than doubled to 130 units.”** |
| 6. “the units of electricity by natural gas and oil were showed sharply decrease, both at 2 units.” | “were showed sharply decrease” 语法错误，应用主动 “showed a sharp decrease”。 | **“Electricity from natural gas and oil showed a sharp decrease, falling to just 2 units each.”** |
| 7. “Nuclear power was never been used in Australia.” | 时态与被动语态错误，应为 “was not used at all”。 | **“Nuclear power was not used at all in Australia.”** |
| 8. “except of hydro power, other four materials were all relatively primary ways of generating electricity in 1980” | “materials” 用词不当，应为 “sources”；“relatively primary” 也不地道。 | **“In France in 1980, apart from hydro power (5 units), the other four sources each generated between 15 and 25 units.”** |
| 9. “natural gas and hydro power were dramatically reduce, both at 2 units.” | 动词形式与搭配错误，应为 “dropped sharply”  | **“Natural gas and hydro power both dropped sharply to 2 units.”** |
| 10. “generation in France became more and more environment friendly,while Australia selected more proportion in fuel source.” | 结论不精准；法国是向核电倾斜，不代表“环保”过度笼统。 | **“In summary, Australia became more coal‐dependent, whereas France shifted heavily towards nuclear power by 2000.”** |

### **写作提升建议**

1. **描述顺序**：先说 1980，再说 2000；先说总量变化，再说各能源对比。  
2. **用词精准**：多用 *doubled, increased sharply, accounted for, showed a decline* 等术语。  
3. **衔接自然**：在段落间使用 *“Overall”, “In contrast”, “By 2000”, “In summary”* 等。  
4. **语法检查**：确保主谓一致、时态正确、冠词和介词使用准确。

按照以上思路改写并反复练习，你的图表报告定能达到 **6.5+**。加油！
