### 提高写作的关键建议

1. **关注数据准确性和时间区间**  
   - 仔细核对题目给出的时间、数值范围，避免出现年份错误或数据偏差。

2. **多样化趋势词汇**  
   - 使用不同动词和副词来描述数据变化（_rose, climbed, declined, fell steadily, fluctuated_ 等），提升行文的可读性和精准度。

3. **加强句子衔接**  
   - 使用 *Meanwhile, By contrast, In addition, However* 等连接词，让段落和句子之间逻辑更清晰。

4. **概括 + 细节 + 对比**  
   - 先在 **Overall** 段概括主要趋势，再在主体段详细描述数据，最后做简短总结，突出主要变化或对比。


**一、描述折线图变化的短语和句型**  
- *"[Subject] declined/increased over the period."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"While the consumption of beef, lamb, and fish declined over the period, chicken consumption increased significantly."*  
  (在整个期间，牛肉、羊肉和鱼的消费量下降，而鸡肉的消费量则显著上升。)

- *"[Subject] rose sharply to approximately [value] by [year]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Chicken rose sharply to approximately 250 grams in 2004."*  
  (鸡肉在2004年急剧上升到大约250克。)

- *"[Subject] fell steadily to around [value] by [year]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Beef then fell steadily to around 100 grams by 2004."*  
  (随后牛肉稳步下降到2004年的约100克。)

---

**二、好的句型和单词**  
- **关键词：**  
  - *consumption*（消费）  
  - *per capita*（人均）  
  - *declined*（下降）  
  - *increased significantly*（显著上升）  
  - *fluctuated*（波动）  
  - *plummeted*（骤降）  
  - *hovering*（徘徊于）  
  - *marked increase*（显著增长）

- **句型：**  
  - *"The line chart compares [subject] from [start year] to [end year]."*  
    **例句：**  
    *"The line chart compares the weekly per capita consumption of chicken, beef, lamb, and fish from 1979 to 2004."*  
    (该折线图比较了1979年至2004年间鸡肉、牛肉、羊肉和鱼的人均每周消费量。)

---

**三、开头与结尾句型**  
- **开头句型：**  
  *"The line chart compares [subject] in [context] from [start year] to [end year]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"The line chart compares the weekly per capita consumption of chicken, beef, lamb, and fish in a European country from 1979 to 2004."*  
  (该折线图比较了1979年至2004年间某欧洲国家鸡肉、牛肉、羊肉和鱼的人均每周消费量。)

- **结尾句型：**  
  *"In summary, [summary of trends]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"In summary, beef and lamb both experienced declines in consumption, while chicken showed a marked increase, and fish consumption remained relatively stable."*  
  (总之，牛肉和羊肉的消费均有所下降，而鸡肉消费显著上升，鱼的消费则相对稳定。)

---

**四、描述趋势在某个时间段发生改变的连接段**  
- *"Although [subject] [trend in initial period], it [trend in later period]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Although beef fluctuated until the mid-1980s, it then fell steadily to around 100 grams by 2004."*  
  (尽管牛肉在1980年代中期之前有所波动，但随后稳步下降到2004年的约100克。)

- *"While [Subject A] [trend], [Subject B] [different trend]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Lamb and chicken both started at roughly 150 grams in 1979, but their trends diverged considerably."*  
  (羊肉和鸡肉在1979年均约为150克，但其走势却大相径庭。)

---

**五、几个折线进行对比的例句**  
- *"In [year], [Subject A] had the highest consumption at around [value], followed by [Subject B] at [value]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"In 1979, beef had the highest consumption level at around 220 grams per person per week, while lamb and chicken were both around 150 grams."*  
  (1979年，牛肉的人均每周消费量约为220克最高，而羊肉和鸡肉均约为150克。)

- *"By contrast, [Subject] remained the lowest, at about [value]."*

  *"By contrast, fish remained the least consumed throughout the period, hovering at about 50 grams per person per week."*  
  (相比之下，鱼在整个期间均为消费量最低，每周每人约50克。)

---

**六、几个折线在同一时间段不同表现的例句**  
- *"During [time period], while [Subject A] [trend], [Subject B] [different trend]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"During the period, while beef declined and lamb plummeted, chicken increased significantly."*  
  (在这一期间，牛肉下降且羊肉骤降，而鸡肉则显著上升。)

- *"Whereas [Subject A] [trend], [Subject B] [contrasting trend]."*  
  **例句：**  
  *"Whereas lamb plummeted to about 50 grams by 2004, chicken surged to approximately 250 grams."*  
  (而羊肉在2004年骤降至约50克，鸡肉则飙升至大约250克。)
