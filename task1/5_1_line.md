### 学习与改进建议

1. **对比与数据描述**  
   - 地图/图表类写作需要清晰、准确地描述数据变化及对比；  
   - 注重数字之间的关系（*highest, lowest, slightly higher, significantly lower* 等），并在段落结构上分清时间段或国别对比。

2. **用词与短语**  
   - 多使用多样化的描述趋势词汇（*rise, increase, climb, peak, remain stable, decline*）和程度副词（*dramatically, slightly, gradually*）来丰富语言。  
   - 避免重复使用同一表达。

3. **语法与结构**  
   - 练习被动语态、动名词、分词短语等，以便在描述数据和变化时更灵活；  
   - 注意时态一致性：若涉及到未来（如 2040 年），可使用将来时（*will, is expected to, is projected to*）或将来完成时（*will have + p.p.*）。

只要在写作时多加留意以上问题并不断练习，你的写作水平一定会稳步提高。祝你学习顺利，取得好成绩！
