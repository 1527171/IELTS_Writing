The line chart compares the amount of cargo transported in the UK between 1972 and 2002 by road, water, rail, pipeline.Overall, The trend of four transported ways had increased over the period.

Transportation by road was the main mode in the UK, around 70 million tonnes.Followed a period of fluctuate steadily,the figure subsequently experience a sharp increase from 1995 to 1998 and then remained stable to about 100 million tonnes in around 2002. The amount of transportation by water was closed with transportation by rail in 1974.While water showed a increased gradually before 1982 and then almost no changed over around two decades,  rail was fell slightly and was exceeded by waterway in 1978 and during the period between 1995 and 2002, the quantity shifted from  dropped to climb steadily and reached 40 million tonnes by 2002.Transportation of pipeline was experienced a gradual growth totally and reached around 20 million tonnes.

In summary, Transportation of road as a main way , while transportation by pipeline as a lowest way through the period. Railway exceeded waterway and became the second way to goods transported in UK.

下面是一篇结构更清晰、数据更准确的示例作文，供你参考。你可结合自身思路进行适当调整。

> **题目：**  
> *The graph below shows the quantities of goods transported in the UK between 1974 and 2002 by four different modes of transport. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*
>
> **范文：**  
> The line chart compares the amount of goods transported by road, water, rail, and pipeline in the UK from 1974 to 2002. Overall, while all four modes showed growth over this period, road consistently carried the largest volume, whereas pipeline remained the least used.
>
> In 1974, road transport accounted for around 70 million tonnes, which was higher than both water and rail at about 40 million tonnes each, and much greater than pipeline at under 10 million tonnes. Over the next two decades, road transport rose steadily, reaching around 80 million tonnes by the mid-1990s, and then increased more sharply to nearly 100 million tonnes by 2002.
>
> Meanwhile, goods carried by water grew from roughly 40 to 55 million tonnes by the early 1980s, remained stable for a while, and then climbed again to around 65 million tonnes in 2002. Rail transport, in contrast, dipped slightly in the early years but recovered after 1995 to finish at about 40 million tonnes. Finally, pipeline usage showed a gradual yet consistent rise throughout the period, peaking at around 20 million tonnes in 2002.
>
> In summary, road transport dominated the entire period, followed by water. Although rail started at the same level as water, it ended lower, while pipeline remained the least utilized but still experienced moderate growth.

### 使用建议

1. **准确引用时间与数据**  
   - 仔细核对题目给出的时间区间，避免写成 1972–2002 等；  
   - 注意各时间节点（1974、1982、1990、2002）或明显变化点（如 1995、1998）的具体数值，确保对比准确。

2. **丰富描述趋势的词汇**  
   - 多使用 *rose, climbed, dipped, remained stable, fluctuated* 等词描述数据变化；  
   - 用副词（*slightly, steadily, sharply, significantly*）或形容词（*dramatic, moderate*）修饰变化程度。

3. **注意逻辑与衔接**  
   - 先在 **Overall** 段概括主要趋势，再在主体段详细描述数据变化及对比；  
   - 使用合适的连接词（*Meanwhile, By contrast, In summary* 等）使行文更连贯。
