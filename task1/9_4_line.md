The line charts illustrates the quantity of six methods to product power between 1980 and 2030 in the USA from  a report by 2008. Overall, petrol and oil, coal, natural gas are the primary ways to energy consumption whether in the past or the future.While nuclear, solar/wind and hydropower always in a low level.
﻿
In 1980,  petrol and oil was the biggest consumption to generation than others, around 35 quadrillion units.Followed a period of dropped, the figures subsequently experience a steadily growth from 1995 onward and will reach 50 in 2030. The energy consumption by coal and natural gas had the trend of synchronization from around 18 in 1980 to around 25 in 2015.From then until 2030 , coal had increased and reached 30 but natural gas remain stabled around 25. Nuclear, solar/wind and hydropower had the similar starting point around 4 and the figure leveled off by 2030, both less than 10.
﻿
In summary, petrol and oil, coal and natural gas always as the main energy consumption in these period, Other three ways only had climbed slightly even declined.

## 二、更优作文范例

以下是一篇结构更清晰、语言更地道的示例作文，供你参考。你可结合自身理解和风格进行适当调整。

> **题目：**  
> *The graph below gives information from a 2008 report about consumption of energy in the USA since 1980 with projections until 2030. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.*
>
> **范文：**  
> The line chart shows the consumption of six different energy sources in the USA from 1980 to 2030, based on a 2008 report. Overall, petrol and oil, coal, and natural gas remain the dominant fuels throughout the period, while nuclear, solar/wind, and hydropower are used to a lesser extent.
>
> In 1980, petrol and oil accounted for around 35 quadrillion units, making them the most consumed energy sources, followed by coal and natural gas at roughly 16 and 20 quadrillion units, respectively. Over the next two decades, petrol and oil fluctuated slightly before rising more steadily after 2000, and they are projected to reach nearly 50 quadrillion units by 2030.
>
> Coal use climbed gradually from about 16 quadrillion units in 1980 to around 25 in 2015, and it is expected to increase further to 30 by 2030. Meanwhile, natural gas consumption hovered between 15 and 25 quadrillion units for most of the period and is forecast to remain near 25 units in 2030.  
>
> By contrast, nuclear, solar/wind, and hydropower started at about 4 quadrillion units each in 1980 and have remained relatively low ever since. Nuclear power is predicted to reach just under 10 quadrillion units by 2030, whereas solar/wind and hydropower are both expected to stay below 10 quadrillion units, with only modest increases over the entire timeframe.

**范文亮点**：  
1. **结构清晰**：分段介绍主要能源（petrol/oil、coal、natural gas）和次要能源（nuclear、solar/wind、hydropower）。  
2. **多样化的趋势描述**：使用了 *fluctuated, climbed gradually, hovered, remained relatively low* 等词汇。  
3. **衔接自然**：运用 *Meanwhile, By contrast, Over the next two decades* 等连接词，让行文更顺畅。

### 使用建议

1. **准确引用数据和时间**  
   - 核对题目给出的时间区间（1980–2030），使用相同单位（“quadrillion units”），并在句子中体现“预测”或“预计”时态（*projected, expected, forecast*）。

2. **丰富描述趋势的词汇**  
   - 多使用 *rose, climbed, dipped, fluctuated, remained stable* 等词，以及 *slightly, steadily, significantly* 等副词来描述变化幅度。

3. **注意衔接与逻辑**  
   - 在主体段落中先概括主要能源（petrol and oil, coal, natural gas），再介绍次要能源（nuclear, solar/wind, hydropower），并使用衔接词（*Meanwhile, By contrast, Over the next two decades*）使行文更连贯。

通过不断练习并注意上述问题，你的写作水平一定会稳步提升。祝你学习顺利并取得好成绩！
